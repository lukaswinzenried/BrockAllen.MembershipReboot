        Your account is confirmed. You can now login 
        <a href="~/Login">here</a>.

    <h2>Error confirming registration</h2>
    <p>
        There was an error confirming the registration. If you have already confirmed your account
        then you should recieve a confirmation email and should be able to login 
        <a href="~/Login">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you would like to re-register click 
        <a href="~/Register">here</a>.
    </p>
}
<p>Thanks!</p>
